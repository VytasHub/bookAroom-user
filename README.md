# Auth0 + AngularJS + Express + Firebase + Node

This project used git.ignore to ignore node modules.IN order to run project locally you need to download project and install few modules listed below.


```cmd
  npm install express
  npm install cors
  npm install express-jwt
  npm install dotenv
```

And than run the node `server.js` command in top directory of the project.

Note: project is currently live so you wont be able to log in  if runing locally because callback url would need to be changed on Auth0 to `http://localhost:3000/`
